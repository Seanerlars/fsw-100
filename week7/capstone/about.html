               <p id="p1">Dennis Reynolds is co-owner and bartender at Carmines. He brings his positive attitude and intense energy everywhere he goes. When he is not working on serving you a Carmine’s signature cocktail, he is making his rounds around our restaurant floor to see that everyone is satisfied. Dennis co-founded Carmines in February of 2015 with the intention of finding the perfect chicken recipe for a new prestigious eatery. Upon discussing with his colleagues, Dennis shifted his focus on making and serving the most delicious steaks in the area. Be sure to say hello as Dennis prides himself on his sociability and fun demeanor.</p>

Mac has an impressive list of combat credentials. Mac is a blue belt in karate and an entrepreneur with his own brand of protein shake called “fight milk.” Despite his extensive background as a rule enforcer, Mac considers himself to be friendly and kind to others. </p>
