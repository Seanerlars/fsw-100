                <p class="p2">The Xbox One may be selling at less than half the rate worldwide of the PS4, and be likely to be caught in total sales by the Nintendo Switch in 2019<br> - 
                but it’s not either the Wii U or the PS Vita. The position is a lot worse for the XBox than it looks to a lot of readers because about 2/3 of XBox 
                One sales have been in the United States,<br> while less than a third of PS4 sales are in the US meaning the XBox looks competitive. 
                 Fundamentally, however, there are two problems with the XBox One: A terrible launch and that Microsoft are short of great exclusives.</p>

        <h3 id="kittenid">January 9th 2016</h3>
        <img id="img3" src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5f083409849b9_w3t2wq1zjv931__700.jpg">
        <p id="p3">Investigated the reaction of 8 kittens when in the presence of mice. The kittens (5 males and 3 females) belonged to 2 litters. The reactions of each kitten to the smell, sight and presence of mice, from the period of post birth blindness till the age of 4 or 5 wks, was tested. Results indicated the presence of an instinct to kill mice which may manifest itself in the kitten before the end of the first month of life. The instinct appeared suddenly and was fairly definite in character, complex, and highly adaptive. The instinct was aroused by the movement and the odor of the mice, but became increasingly difficult to evoke after the age of 3 to 5 mos. Imitation may also contribute to the awakening of this instinct, but no such opportunity was provided during the experiments. Suggests that the female kitten has a more highly developed instinct than the male. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</p>

        <h2 id="box">Box Spring Tired of being Sober. Wants to get Sprung</h2>
        <h3 id="boxid">March 17th 2020</h3>
        <img id="img4" src="https://www.mc-junk.com/wp-content/uploads/old-discarded-mattress-320x213.jpg">
        <p id="p4">There is one question old couples, new parents, voluntary bachelors, busy young adults, and the single workaholics have been asking for decades now – “Does my bed need a box spring?” If you are awake night after night, tossing and turning in your bed, it is unlikely that this question is driving your sleep away. Modern mattresses come with complete support, and they do not necessarily need the help of a box spring to offer complete comfort. A box spring or a foundation is the base component that can provide optimum support to the mattress. This protects them from wear and tear for long periods of time. People sometimes manage to use the same mattress for more than a decade.</p>
